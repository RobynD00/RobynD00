## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Robyn

I am a final-year Software Engineering student with a strong focus on Java. I am actively building my skills in the Spring Boot framework and React, with an interest in modern backend and full-stack development.

## What Iâ€™m Learning
- Java SE/EE
- Spring Boot (REST APIs, Spring Data, Spring Security)
- Testing with JUnit & Mockito

I have 3 years of professional experience â€” 2 years as a Full-Stack Developer and 1 year as a Junior Developer.

## What I Do at Work
- Build full-stack applications using PHP, JavaScript (jQuery), HTML5 & CSS
- Develop responsive internal systems used by 100+ staff
- Design, optimize & maintain MySQL databases
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams for feature delivery and support

> All code is stored in private enterprise repositories. I am happy to demo live systems or provide sanitized code samples during interviews.

I am open to all software development roles, particularly where I can grow my skills in Java, Spring Boot and React.
